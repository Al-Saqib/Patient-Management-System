# Project for CPSC 210 Summer Term-2

## A patient management system for a diagnostic center

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.





## User Stories 

The following are the *user stories* for the application:

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new patient to a list of patients
- As a user, I want to be able view the history of the patient
- As a user, I want to be able to update the history of the patient
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a patient from a list of patients
