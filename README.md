# Project for CPSC 210 Summer Term-2

## A patient management application for a diagnostic center

:arrow_forward: This is my first desktop application written in java, developed for CPSC-210 class at UBC.  

:arrow_forward: This application will be used for maintaining a patient database system, where the user will be able to 
add a new patient and view, update and delete patient information. 

:arrow_forward: The application will be used by diagnostic center management team. 

:arrow_forward: This project is of interest to me because my father is a doctor and I want to help streamline the patient 
management system in his diagnostic center so that he can focus more time on interacting with and helping his patients instead of 
being bogged down by trying to find patient information and history.
